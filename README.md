# Elite-Estates
Elite Estate is a web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JS), JQuery, AJAX, PHP, and MySQL. The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly platform for real estate agents and potential buyers to interact and manage real estate listings.

The application allows users to browse available properties, view property details, contact agents, and submit inquiries. 

The application also allows administrative tasks such as inserting a property type or an agent, listing of properties, viewing those properties and deleting as well.

## Note
Note that this is a college project and not the final version to be uploaded on a web server or a domain. Some real life changes are to be applied.
